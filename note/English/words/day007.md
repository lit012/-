> recommend struggle expensive bottle locate propose notion unique contrast extent

When you are trying to **locate** a special gift for a friend, it might be a bit of a **struggle**. I **recommend** considering a **unique** item, like an **expensive** perfume **bottle**. The idea of giving something so luxurious might seem like a bold **notion**, but I **propose** that the **contrast** between a common gift and this exquisite one can greatly show the **extent** of your appreciation.
