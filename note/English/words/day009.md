> launch regime accident appearance possibly estate silence ought capacity obvious


When the new **estate** was **launched**, everyone was excited about its modern **appearance**. However, a small **accident** happened that day, which made the event less perfect. The strict **regime** of safety measures in place **ought** to have prevented such a thing, but it seemed there was a gap in their **capacity** to handle unexpected situations. The **silence** that fell over the crowd was a clear sign that everyone was shocked. It was **obvious** that the **accident** was **possibly** avoidable if more careful planning had been done before the **launch**.
