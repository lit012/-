> acknowledge bridge conclude package component ethnic internal ensure era belong


In this new **era**, it is essential to **acknowledge** the **ethnic** diversity that makes up our society. Each group brings its own **component** to the cultural **package**, which we must **ensure** is valued and respected. To foster a sense of **belonging**, we need to build a **bridge** between different **ethnic** communities. This internal **bridge** will help us **conclude** that unity in diversity is our strength. By doing so, we can **ensure** that everyone feels they **belong** in this **era** of cultural richness.
